# Write your MySQL query statement below

# Method 1
# SELECT Score, 
# (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Score) FROM Scores WHERE Score >= s.Score) as Rank 
# FROM Scores s ORDER BY Score DESC;

# Method 2(和方法一类似)
# SELECT Score,
# (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT Score s FROM Scores) t WHERE s >= Score) Rank
# FROM Scores ORDER BY Score DESC;

# Method 3
SELECT s.Score, COUNT(DISTINCT t.Score) Rank
FROM Scores s JOIN Scores t ON s.Score <= t.Score
GROUP BY s.Id 
ORDER BY s.Score DESC;
